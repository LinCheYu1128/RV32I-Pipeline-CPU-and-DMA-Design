# DESCRIPTION: Verilator output: Makefile for building Verilated archive or executable
#
# Execute this makefile from the object directory:
#    make -f Vtop_SoC.mk

default: Vtop_SoC

### Constants...

# SystemC output mode?  0/1 (from --sc)
VM_SC = 0
# Legacy or SystemC output mode?  0/1 (from --sc)
